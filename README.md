                              Detection and Identification of Apple Plant Diseases using MobileNetV2 with Attention Mechanism. 
 Agriculture is crucial for global food security, contributing to about 50% of the global population. Horticulture contributes 30% to India's GDP, with apple production increasing in recent years. However, the Indian agriculture industry, which accounts for 16% of GDP and employs 60% of the population, faces significant challenges in preventing plant diseases. In 2016, agricultural losses reached 13 billion dollars. The valley of Kashmir holds the largest share of apple production, with over 75% of land under cultivation. However, diseases like Alternaria, Scab, and Mosaic pose significant threats to the industry. In 2013, Alternaria spread like wildfire, causing extensive fruit fall and decreased production. In 2020, a severe scab infection affected over 30% of crops, despite fungicides. Infections in plants can be categorized into biotic and abiotic diseases.
 Apple leaf diseases include Alternaria leaf spot, Frogeye leaf spot, Apple Mosaic Virus, and Scab in apple. Alternaria leaf spot is a fungal disease caused by the Alternaria species complex, causing premature defoliation and fruit damage. It is a significant problem in apple production, leading to defoliation, fruit damage, and economic losses. Cure for Alternaria involves using fungicides, improving sanitation and crop rotation, removing winter prunings and fallen leaves, and ensuring proper spacing and thinning. Frogeye leaf spot is caused by Botryosphaeria obtusa, overwintering in dead bark, cankers, and mummified fruit. Cure for Frogeye leaf spot involves fungicides, pruning, sanitation, and preventing moisture on leaves. Apple Mosaic Virus is a viral disease that affects apple trees, causing distinctive symptoms on leaves, stunted growth, and reduced yields. Cure for Mosaic involves using virus-free plants, removing infected trees, removing infected plant parts, and keeping orchards insect-free.
 This project aims to develop a deep learning-based system using the MobileNetV2 with Attention mechanism to classify and detect diseases in apple plant leaves. The goal is to provide farmers with an easy-to-use, efficient, and accurate tool for early disease identification, enabling more timely interventions and reducing crop losses. The challenge lies in creating a robust model capable of distinguishing between healthy and diseased leaves with high accuracy, ensuring the model is lightweight and optimized for mobile deployment without sacrificing performance, and handling variations in lighting, background, and environmental conditions in the images used for detection. The project involved data collection, annotation, pre-processing, and finalizing a dataset of 12,602 images. The deep convolutional neural network (CNN) was built based on the MobileNetV2 architecture, classifying apple plant leaves into various disease categories, including healthy, apple scab, black rot, and leaf blotch.

 This study aims to develop a lightweight deep CNN model for diagnosing four diseases in apple plants using leaf images. The model, MobilenetV2, uses a step-by-step methodology including data collection, pre-processing, model setup, training, evaluation, deployment, and improvement. The model uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to process and analyze image data, creating feature maps that capture different patterns. The CNNs have been successfully applied to various applications, including image recognition, object detection, medical image analysis, and natural language processing.

The model uses a convolutional layer, which applies filters to the input image, creates feature maps, and then down-samples the feature maps. The pooling layer down-samples the feature maps, reducing computational cost and preventing over-fitting. The fully connected layer combines the outputs of the convolutional and pooling layers into a single vector, often used for classification or regression tasks.

The proposed methodology aims to reduce computational burden and improve the efficiency of disease detection in handheld devices like smartphones.
